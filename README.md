# Introduction to NausiCAä

NausiCAä is an application and library for creating visualizations
of computation on discrete lattices in one, two, or three dimensions.
Lattices are composed of "cells", where each cell has a coordinate
in the lattice. A lattice may be composed of either non-negative integer
values, or non-negative real values.

In summary, NausiCAä creates visualizations of computations that are similar to
cellular automata, with some notable differences. But the name stuck,
so here we are.

This documentation is organized into three main sections. First, we describe
the various concepts that NausiCAä uses to create visualizations. Second,
we cover how to use the GUI application. Third, we provide a reference guide
and example automata.

(Note: In this guide, we use the Mac syntax "⌘" when denoting the meta key
in keyboard shortcuts for GUI commands. Substitute this with whatever meta key
is appropriate for your OS.)

## Automata

*Automata* are a collection of various parameters that are used to generate
visualizations. These parameters include *Rules*, *Sequences*, *Neighborhood*,
*Dimensions*, *Colors*, *Values*, *Palette*, *Language*, *Value Kind*, and
more, and are described in the following sections.

Automata can be loaded and saved, and the visualizations generated by them
can be exported. Automata are stored as `.ca` files in JSON text format,
and so can be manipulated via any text editor or other program in
addition to the GUI itself. Visualizations are exported in PNG format.
Video frames can also be generated (i.e., each iteration of the evaluation
is exported as a PNG file in sequence order), or alternatively the entire
set of iterations can be exported as a single animated GIF file.

## Rules

Visualizations are generated by *Rules* which are specified using the following
syntax:

```
Cycles[/Weight[;Decay]]:Incantation
```

* Cycles: Positive integer indicating the number of iterations this incantation will
run (only relevant if using Sequences, which will be explained later).
* Weight: Optional update weight (default 1.0). A real value that will be
multiplied to rule output value. Can be used to decrease or increase the
"speed" at which the lattice changes.
* Decay: Optional weight decay (default 1.0). A real value that if set will
change the weight value with each iteration, i.e. weight' = weight * decay.
* Incantation: A kind of genome-like set of codons, written as syllables in
the *Machine Elvish* language, which is described in the
[Machine Elvish](#machine-elvish) section below.

## Sequences

A *Sequence* is a list of rules that run in serial one after the other.
Each rule in a sequence is called a *Stage*, and runs for its cycle time,
and when the end of the list is reached the sequence repeats with the first
rule.

The syntax is simply a list of Rules separated by newlines:

```
Cycles1[/Weight1[;Decay1]]:Incantation1
Cycles2[/Weight2[;Decay2]]:Incantation2
...
```

## Neighborhoods

A *Neighborhood* defines the set of neighboring cells that are available
for use during incantation evaluation. Several types of neighborhoods
are supported.

All neighborhood types also support a *size* attribute that is a positive
integer. Size 1 means only include cells directly adjacent to the self
cell, and each subsequent value (2, 3, ...) expands that range by 1 cell.

### Moore

All neighboring cells in both cardinal directions and kitty-corner,
including self.

### von Neumann

All neighboring cells in cardinal directions, including self.

### Circular

All cells within a discrete approximation of a circle around the
self cell, including self. Note that circular neighborhoods only
make sense for size > 1, otherwise the neighborhood degenerates
into a von Neumann neighborhood.

## Value Kinds

The automata's *Kind* defines the type of value stored in each cell in
the lattice.

### Discrete

Discrete lattices contain integer values (i.e., Java int type).

### RGB

RGB lattices contain (red, green, blue) colorspace values in the range
of 0-255 packed into integer values. Note that these lattices have
no configurable palette, since the RGB value is directly stored in
the lattice.

### RGBA

RGBA lattices contain (red, green, blue, alpha) colorspace values
in the range of 0-255 packed into integer values. Note that these
lattices have no configurable palette, since the RGBA value is
directly stored in the lattice.

### Continuous

Continues lattices contain real values (i.e., Java double type).

## Machine Elvish

Machine Elvish is a simple language for expressing computations. It is
structured as a sequence of syllables (aka codons) which forms an "incantation"
and evaluates over a state which is represented as a stack. Values are pushed
to or popped from the stack by each syllable, and the stack may be
manipulated in other ways as well.

Let's look at a very simple example incantation:

```
ya
```

This incantation consists of one syllable, "ya". The "ya" syllable represents
a computation where the current value of the lattice at the coordinate being
evaluated is pushed onto the stack.

## Evaluation

An incantation is evaluated for each cell in the lattice. During evaluation,
the incantation may store temporary state in a "stack" via push, pop, and
related operations. When evaluation is finished, a final value is popped from
the stack, and this becomes the new cell value. (Weight may also be applied
at this point, if it was specified in the incantation.)

### Compound codons

Codons may also be "fused" together to create compound codons which will be
mutated as an atomic unit using the "+" connector. For example:

```
ki ya+a1+mi2 mu
```

The compound codon in this incantation adds 1 to the current cell. When the
incantation is mutated, for example by swapping the order of two codons, it
will be treated as a single codon. So a swap mutation might result in:

```
ya+a1+mi2 ki mu
```

This compound codon, slightly more complex, generates a series of circles:

```
kya0+kya0+mu2+kya1+kya1+mu2+mi2+ni
```

Listing the codons out one by one:

```
    kya0    Coord
    kya0    Coord
    mu2     Muln
    kya1    Coord
    kya1    Coord
    mu2     Muln
    mi2     Sumn
    ni      Sqrt
```

One might recognize this as an encoding of Pythagoras's distance formula, and results in
the visualization:

![Circular rings](assets/images/circularrings.png)

### Variables

Incantations may contain "variables", which are demarcated by ```{varname}```
within the incantation. For example:

```
a{var1}
```

Represents a Constant codon whose value is whatever the value of ```var1```
is set to. Variables are set at execution time and fixed throughout the run.

# Using the NausiCAä GUI

## Main Window

By default, the main window shows 9 subwindows arranged in a 3x3 grid. The
center window displays the "current" automata. Arranged around the center
window are 8 random variations on the current automata, generated by "mutating"
the current automata's incantation or other attributes.

![Main Window screenshot](assets/images/multiverse.png)

By clicking on any of 8 surrounding subwindows, you "select" that mutation
as the new "current" mutation. It becomes the new center subwindow and 8
subsequent mutations are generated based on it. If instead you click the
center subwindow, then it remains the current mutation and 8 different random
mutations are generated.

This allows you to arrive at interesting automata by making repeated slight
modifications to automata.

The command ``Window | Hide mutations (⌘Y)`` allows you to hide (or show)
mutations so you can focus on the current automata. Continuing the above
example, after hiding mutations the main window will appear as:

![Main Window hide mutations screenshot](assets/images/multiverse-single.png)

## Info Window

The info window at ``Automata | Info (⌘I)`` displays a summary of the
current automata.

![Info Window screenshot](assets/images/infowindow.png)

## Basic Parameters Window

Basic automata parameters are set with ``Automata | Configure parameters ... (⌘ K)``.
This can be used to set lattice *width*, *height*, and *depth* (if appropriate).
It can also set *prelude*, which is the number of iterations to evaluate
before rendering the initial visualization.

![Basic Params Window screenshot](assets/images/caparameters.png)

Depth is interpreted differently depending on the dimensionality of the
automaton and the configured rendering mode.

For 2D automata, depth is used to retain some number of prior lattice
states. Then, if the main window is in 2D view mode, the current and
all prior states of each lattice cell are projected into a single pixel
in the visualization based on the rendering mode (see Rendering Modes
for details). If instead the main window is in 3D mode, then the current and
all prior states are rendered as a 3D rectangle, with current state at
the "top" of the Y (vertical) axis.

For 3D automata, depth is simply the 3rd dimension of the automata's lattice
space, rather than a collection of prior states as with 2D automata. Other
than that difference, view rendering follows the same process as with 2D
automata.

This window also allows you to set a "name" for the automaton. This is arbitrary
descriptive text and does not in any way affect computation or visualization.

## Rule Editor Window

The rule editor window at ``Window | Show rule editor (⌘G)`` displays
(or hides) the current automata's rules, as described in [Rules](#rules).
**Implementation Note:** Be sure the cursor is positioned at the end of
the rule(s) before hitting *enter* to set the new rules, otherwise rule(s)
will be truncated (this window will be improved in a future release).

![Rule Editor Window screenshot](assets/images/ruleeditor.png)

## Palette Editor Window

The palette editor window at ``Window | Show palette editor`` displays
(or hides) the current automata's color palette. **Implementation note:**
The palette editor should only be used with small numbers of colors; there
is no hard limit, but selecting invididual colors by hand only really scales
when there are less than, say, 100 colors. For larger palettes, use one
of the commands under the ``Palette`` menu instead, which are designed to
deal with huge palettes.

![Palette Editor Window screenshot](assets/images/paletteeditor.png)

## Update Mode

*Update mode* determines how and when values in the lattice are updated.

* Synchronous: All cell updates occur as a single, atomic operation.
* Asynchronous: Cell updates occur at the specified probability in range (0.0-1.0),
with 1.0 being equivalent to Synchronous update mode.
* Local Asynchronous: 
* Energy Asynchronous: 
* Variable: 

## Edge Mode

* Toroidal: The edge "wraps around", that is, the top/bottom and left/right
edges are considered to be contiguous to each other.
* Zero: All cells outside the visible area are considered to be 0.
* Constant: All cells outside the visible area are considered to be the
specified value.

## External Force

* None: Lattice cell values are determined solely by the update rule.
* Random: Randomly-valued "snow" is introduced to the lattice at the specified
frequency.

## Animation

Animation for both 2D and 3D automata can be started/stopped with the
``Animation | Animate (⌘A)`` command. Animation iterates through successive
evaluations of the automaton's rule. (1D automata cannot be animated because
successive rule evaluations are simply displayed on the vertical axis.)

The amount of resources consumed by animation is configurable with the
``Animation | Configure animation ...`` command. At present, only the
``Compute cores`` option is used; ``Render cores`` is unused but may be used
in the future.

**Generate to disk**

The ``Animation | Generate to disk (⌘D)`` command can write individual
animation frames to a directory as separate PNG files, or it can generate
an entire animation as a single animated GIF file.

![Generate to Disk Window screenshot](assets/images/generatedisk.png)
* Width & Height: Override currently-configured automata size values. (TODO:
add similar for depth.)
* Animate: If checked, each individual frame, or an animated GIF, will be
written to disk.
* Framerate: Framerate for GIFs. Has no effect on frames.
* Scaling: Scale factor for frames, e.g., setting this to 0.5 will downscale
generated frames by 50%.
* Cores: Number of compute threads to use in animation pipeline.
* Skip frames: Skip over some number of frames during generation. The frames
are still computed, but are not written to disk. This can be useful to reduce
the size of generated data for slowly-evolving automata. Affects both frame
generation and animated GIFs.
* Create GIF: If checked, output will be a single animated GIF file.
* Reverse: Generate frames in reverse (i.e., if generating 100 frames, then
frame 0 will be numbered 99, 1 will be 98, etc.).
* Big Bounce: Generate frames from the middle out. This results in a
wrap-around kind of effect.

(Note: for the tasks of GIF post-processing and making movies from frames,
the author recommends the excellent ``gifsicle`` and ``ffmpeg``. Of course
you can use whatever programs work for you.)

## Making Mutations

Mutations can be applied in several ways:
* By selecting one of the randomly-generated mutations in the main window
(shown with ⌘Y).
* By using the ``Mutations`` menu to specifically select a type of
incantation mutation.
* By enabling other kinds of mutations like *Weight variations*,
*Hue variations*, *Parameter variations*, and *Initializer variations*,
which are found under the ``Mutations`` menu. When enabled, these
mutations will also show up as randomly-generated mutations in the main
window.

## Sequences, Stages, and Mutations

Recall that a [Sequence](#sequences) is a series of Stages composed of Rules
which execute one after the other, then repeat from the beginning.

Stages can be added or removed using the ``Mutate | Add rule stage`` and
``Mutate | Remove active rule stage`` commands. By default, the
*active rule stage* becomes the most-recently added stage. This may be
configured under ``Mutate | Parameters...`` (*Mutation stage*), with the
first stage being numbered 0. If the *mutation stage* is set to -1,
then all stages will be subject to mutation.

## Rendering Modes

**Composition Modes**

Depending on how composition is configured, the same automata may be visualized
in different ways. For example, here is the same 200x200x40 2D automata
with prelude 20 rendered first with ``Render | Composition mode | Nearest only``
and then as ``Render | Composition mode | Weighted average``:

![Nearest only screenshot](assets/images/nearestonly.png) ![Weighted avg screenshot](assets/images/weightedavg.png)

These and other *composition modes* affect how the "depth" dimension is rendered
to the two-dimensional visualization. (TODO: Not all composition modes are
currented supported at all dimensions.)

* Nearest only: Use only the first non-zero cell value in range (depth-1,0).
* Farthest only: Use only the first non-zero cell value in range (0,depth-1).
* Weighted average: Use an average of all cell values, weighting those with higher
depth (i.e., more recent iterations) higher.
* Weighted average reverse: Use an average of all cell values, weighting those with
lower depth (i.e., less recent iterations) higher.
* Average: Use an average of all cell values, weighed equally.
* Channel: Depth must be set to 3 or 4. With depth 3, renders packed RGB
values using depths (0,1,2). With depth 4, renders packed RGBA values using
depths (0,1,2,3).
* Multiply: Uses a value computed from cells at all depths multiplied together,
normalized between (0,255).
* Difference: Uses a value computed from the total difference between each
successive cell value at all depths, normalized by depth.
* True Nearest: Uses only the cell value at the highest depth.

## A Few Important Commands

Here is a brief list of a few of the more often-used GUI commands.

**File menu: Handling automata files**
* ⌘N - Create a new automata
* ⌘S - Save current automata
* ⌘O - Open a previously-saved automata

**Automata menu: Basic automata parameters**
* ⌘K - Set lattice width, height, and depth (if appropriate).
Also sets prelude, which is the number of iterations to go
through before rendering the initial visualization.
* ⌘I - Display an informational window describing the current automata.

**Automata menu: Setting initial lattice state**
* ⌘B - Use a random initial state; the lattice is set to random
values within the value space weighted toward 0 based on the zero

* ⌘F - Use a "fixed" initial state; the specified coordinate is
set to the specified value (or -1,-1,... for center) and all other
coordinates are set to 0.
* ⌘G - Gaussian initial state; one or more clusters of values are
created based on specified attributes.
* ⌘L - Clustered Gaussian initial state; similar to Gaussian initial
state, but values for each cluster are pulled from different value

# Reference Guide

## Codon Catalog

### a (Constant)

Syntax: `a*Value*`

Pushes *Value* onto the stack, where *Value* is any integer or real value.
**Note that discrete automata may only use integer values.**

### ba (Bitwise Left Rotate)

Syntax: `ba`

Pushes the bitwise-left-rotated value of the top stack value rotated by the next
top stack value. **Note that this is only supported for discrete automata.
For continuous automata, the top stack value will simply be pushed back on the stack.**

### be (Greater Than)

Syntax: `be`

Pushes `1` if `v1>v2`, else `0`. where v1 and v2 are the top two stack values.

### bo (Negate)

Syntax: `bo`

Pushes the negation of the top stack value. For example, if the stack is
[5 3 1], the new stack will be [5 3 -1].

### bu (Less Than)

Syntax: `bu`

Pushes `1` if `v1<v2`, else `0`. where v1 and v2 are the top two stack values.

### chi (Min)

Syntax: `chi*Value*`

Pushes the minimum value of the top *Value* values onto the stack. *Value*
is optional; if not specified, all values on the stack are considered
(i.e., the entire stack).

### cho (Bandpass)

Syntax: `cho`

Uses the top three stack values as `up`, `low`, and `mid` to determine if
`mid` falls between `low` and `up`, inclusive. If true, pushes `mid`, otherwise
pushes `0`.

### da (Data Block)

Syntax: `da*Data*`

TBD.

### de (Hyperpolic Tangent)

Syntax: `de`

Pushes the hyperbolic tangent of the top stack value. **This codon only
works with continuous automata. For discrete automata, it does nothing.**

### do (Duplicate)

Syntax: `do`

Peeks at the top stack value and pushes it again. For example, if the
stack is `1 2 3 4`, then the result is `1 2 3 4 4`.

### e (Avg N)

Syntax: `e`

Pushes the average of the last N values onto the stack, where N is the top
value on the stack, and not included in the average. For example, if the stack
consists of `4 2 1 3`, then N is 3 and `(4+2+1)/3` will be pushed.

### ga (Halt)

Syntax: `ga`

Pushes Self and stops evaluation.

### ge (Push All Rotate)

Syntax: `ge`

Pushes all Neighbor cell values including Self onto the stack, "rotated"
by the top stack value. For example, if the top value is 4, pushes cells
beginning at index 4.

### gi (Avg)

Syntax: `gi*Value*`

Pushes the average of the top *Value* values onto the stack. If *Value* is not
specified, then the entire stack is considered.

### go (Push All)

Syntax: `go`

Pushes all Neighbor cell values including Self onto the stack. Self is
always pushed last.

### gu (Count **DEPRECATED - BROKEN - Use `pu` instead**)

Syntax: `gu`

Counts the number of values in the pattern that are equal to the top stack
value and pushes the count. **Note: Does not actually do this, use `pu` instead.**

### ha (Exclamatory)

Syntax: `ha`

Pushes `N!`, where N is determined by the top stack value. **Note 1: This
can be quite expensive to compute for large values. There are no guardrails
and no overflow check.**
**Note 2: For continuous automata, this does nothing.**

### he (Convolve)

Syntax: `he`

Pushes a value computed by summing and multiplying parts of the pattern and
the stack.

### hi (Histogram)

Syntax: `hi`

Computes a histogram of all values in Pattern and pushes it to the stack
in size order. For example, if the pattern is `1 5 7 2 5 7 7 7 1`, then
it will push `1 2 2 4`.

### ho (Divide)

Syntax: `ho`

Pushes the division of the top two values onto the stack. In the case of division
by zero, simply pushes the top value back.

### hu (Supersymmetry)

Syntax: `hu`

Pushes the value that is "opposite" to the top stack value and the middle value,
based on the number of colors in the automata. For example, if the automata
has 4 colors, then color 1 is opposite color 2, and color 0 is opposite color 3.

### i (Pow)

Syntax: `i`

Pushes v1^v2^ onto the stack, where v1 and v2 are popped off the stack.
**Note that for discrete automata, if v2 is less than 0 it will be replaced
by 0.**

### ja (Jump)

Syntax: `ja`

"Jumps" forward or backward a number of codons determined by the top stack value.
This can allow evaluations to loop (by jumping backward), or to skip (by jumping
forward). There is a maximum number of codon evaluations allowed per cell, so
infinite loops are impossible. This is currently set to 1000. In such cases, the
evaluation is forcibly terminated, with the evaluation result being whatever value
was at the top when the loop was broken.

### ji (Skip N)

Syntax: `ji`

Pops N values off the stack, where N is determined by the top stack value (which
is popped before the skip and thus not counted as part of the skip).

### jo (Min N)

Syntax: `jo`

Pushes the minimum of the last N values onto the stack, where N is the top
value on the stack, and not included in the minimum. For example, if the stack
consists of `4 2 1 3`, then N is 3 and `1` will be pushed.

### jya (Relative Coordinate)

Syntax: `jya[0|1|2]`

For continuous automata, pushes either the relative `x`, `y`, or `z` cell
coordinate, depending on which numeric argument is used. If no numeric
argument is specified, pushes all available coordinates, depending on the
dimensionality of the automata. Relative coordinates range from -1.0 to 1.0,
with 0.0 at the center of the lattice. For discrete automata, functions
the same as `kya`.

### ka (Bitwise Or)

Syntax: `ka`

Pushes the bitwise-or value of the top two stack values. **Note that this is
only supported for discrete automata. For continuous automata, the top stack value
will simply be pushed back on the stack.**

### ke (Greater)

Syntax: `ke`

Pushes 1 or 0, depending on whether `v1>=v2`, where v1 and v2 are the top two
stack values.

### ki (Push Surrounding)

Syntax: `ki`

Pushes all surrounding cells values onto the stack. The definition of
"surrounding" depends on two factors: (1) Neighborhood type (Moore, von Neumann,
or Circular), and (2) Neighborhood size.

### ko (Bitwise Rotate Left)

Syntax: `ko`

Pushes the bitwise-left-rotated value of the top stack value rotated by the next
top stack value. **Note that this is only supported for discrete automata.
For continuous automata, the top stack value will simply be pushed back on the stack.**

### ku (Bitwise Rotate Right)

Syntax: `ku`

Pushes the bitwise-right-rotated value of the top stack value rotated by the next
top stack value. **Note that this is only supported for discrete automata.
For continuous automata, the top stack value will simply be pushed back on the stack.**

### kya (Coordinate)

Syntax: `kya[0|1|2]`

Pushes either the `x`, `y`, or `z` cell coordinate, depending on which numeric
argument is used. If no numeric argument is specified, pushes all available
coordinates, depending on the dimensionality of the automata.

### ma (Equals)

Syntax: `ma`

Pushes 1 or 0, depending on whether `v1=v2`, where v1 and v2 are the top two
stack values.

### me (Sum N)

Syntax: `me`

Pushes the sum of the top N values onto the stack, where N is the top
value on the stack, and not included in the sum. For example, if the stack
consists of `4 2 1 3`, then N is 3 and `4+2+1` will be pushed.

### mi (Sum)

Syntax: `mi*Value*`

Pushes the sum of the top *Value* values onto the stack. *Value* is optional;
if not specified, all values on the stack are summed (i.e., the entire stack).

### mo (Modulo)

Syntax: `mo`

Pushes `v1%v2`, where v1 and v2 are the top two stack values. If v2 is 0,
simply pushes v1.

### mu (Multiply)

Syntax: `mu*Value*`

Pushes the product of the top *Value* values onto the stack. *Value* is optional;
if not specified, all values on the stack are multiplied (i.e., the entire stack).

### mya (Mandelbulb)

Syntax: `nya`

Pushes the Mandelbulb Set value using the top five values on the stack, defined
in order as `scl` (scaling factor), `z` (iterations), `x`, and `y`, and `z`
(coordinates). For safety, iterations is capped at 100. While this codon is
intended to be used with 3D automata, it can be used with any dimensionality
since the coordinate values are popped from the stack. Note that this produces
a *discrete approximation* of the fractal, as lattices are discrete in nature.

### na (Lesser)

Syntax: `na`

Pushes 1 or 0, depending on whether `v1<=v2`, where v1 and v2 are the top two
stack values.

### ne (Not Equals)

Syntax: `ne`

Pushes 1 or 0, depending on whether `v1!=v2`, where v1 and v2 are the top two
stack values.

### ni (Square Root)

Syntax: `ni`

Pushes the square root of the absolute value of the top of the stack.

### no (Push N)

Syntax: `no`

Pushes the Nth pattern value, where N is determined by the top value on the
stack. The pattern contains both neighbor cells and self.

### nu (Cube Root)

Syntax: `nu`

Pushes the cube root of the top of the stack.

### nya (Mandelbrot)

Syntax: `nya`

Pushes the Mandelbrot Set value using the top four values on the stack, defined
in order as `scl` (scaling factor), `z` (iterations), `x`, and `y` (coordinates).
For safety, iterations is capped at 100. While this codon is
intended to be used with 2D automata, it can be used with any dimensionality
since the coordinate values are popped from the stack. Note that this produces
a *discrete approximation* of the fractal, as lattices are discrete in nature.
 
### o (Push Neighbor)

Syntax: `o*Neighbor*`

Pushes *Neighbor* onto the stack, where *Neighbor* is the index of any cell
in the set of neighboring cells. Index values wrap around, so attempts to push
indeces greater than the size of the set of neighbors are "safe".

### pa (Push Cardinal)

Syntax: `pa`

Pushes all cells lying in cardinal directions from the main cell.

### pe (Absolute Value)

Syntax: `pe`

Pushes the absolute value of the top stack value.

### pi (Filter)

Syntax: `pi*Value*`

**Bugged**

### po (Equals Array)

Syntax: `po*Value*`

If an entire array up to length *Value* is equivalent to a compared array,
returns 1, else 0.

### pu (Count - Fixed)

Syntax: `pu`

Counts the number of values in the pattern that are equal to the top stack
value and pushes the count.

### ra (If)

Syntax: `ra`

Pops the top three stack values as *cond*, *tr*, and *fl* (condition, true case,
and false case). If *cond* is non-zero, pushes *tr*, otherwise pushes *fl*.

### ri (Max N)

Syntax: `jo`

Pushes the maximum of the last N values onto the stack, where N is the top
value on the stack, and not included in the maximum. For example, if the stack
consists of `4 2 1 3`, then N is 3 and `4` will be pushed.

### re (Sine)

Syntax: `re`

Pushes the sine of the top stack value. **This codon only works with continuous
automata. For discrete automata, it does nothing.**

### ro (Skip)

Syntax: `ro*Value*`

Pops *Value* values off the stack.

### ru (Sigmoid)

Syntax: `ru`

Pushes the sigmoid of the top stack value. Specifically, 1/(1+e^-*v*^), where
*v* is the top stack value. **This codon only works with continuous automata.
For discrete automata, it does nothing.**

### sa (Stop)

Syntax: `sa`

The top of the stack is popped, and if 0 stops evaluation.

### se (Not)

Syntax: `se`

Pushes 1 if the top stack value is 0, otherwise pushes 0.

### shi (Position)

Syntax: `shi`

Pushes the current position (i.e., size) of the stack. For example,
if the stack is "5 3 3 1", then pushes 4.

### so (Not Intersects)

Syntax: `so`

Tests if `mid<low || mid>high`, where all three values are popped off the stack
in the order high, low, mid. Pushes 1 (true) or 0 (false).

### su (Subtract)

Syntax: `su`

Pushes `v1-v2`, where v1 and v2 are the top two stack values.

### ta (Max)

Syntax: `ta*Value*`

Pushes the maximum value of the top *Value* values onto the stack. *Value*
is optional; if not specified, all values on the stack are considered
(i.e., the entire stack).

### te (Time)

Syntax: `te`

Pushes the current iteration count, starting from 0. **Note that for animated
automata, this value will only be consistent over the duration of a single
animation execution. If the animation is stopped and started again, time will
reset to 0. For step animation, the value will always be 0.**

### to (Bitwise And)

Syntax: `to`

Pushes the bitwise-and value of the top two stack values. **Note that this is
only supported for discrete automata. For continuous automata, the top stack value
will simply be pushed back on the stack.**

### tsu (Bitwise Xor)

Syntax: `tsu`

Pushes the bitwise-xor value of the top two stack values. For continuous automata,
real values are converted bitwise to integers, then bitwise back to reals
after the xor operation.

### wa (Most)

Syntax: `wa*Value*`

Pushes the value that occurs the most of times in the pattern.

### wo (Least)

Syntax: `wo*Value*`

Pushes the value that occurs the least of times in the pattern.

### u (Intersects)

Syntax: `u`

Tests if `low<=mid<=high`, where all three values are popped off the stack.
Pushes 1 (true) or 0 (false).

### ya (Self)

Syntax: `ya`

Pushes the current cell value onto the stack.

### yo (Intersects Self)

Syntax: `yo`

Tests if `low<=mid<=high`, where all three values are popped off the stack.
Pushes `mid` if true, or 0 if false.

### yu (Fork)

Syntax: `yu*Value*`

Fork skips over a variable number of stack values based on a Neighbor value,
specified by index using the optional *Value*. If *Value* is not specified,
Self is used. This can also be used to effectively branch evaluation within
the incantation if used in tandem with Stop codons for each branch. Further
description TBD as this works in mysterious ways and I'm tired.

### za (Halt)

Syntax: `za`

Stops evaluation. The evaluation result is whatever value is currently the
top stack value.

### ze (Random)

Syntax: `ze`

Pushes a random value between 1 and N, where N is determined by the top stack
value. If N is negative, pushes a random value between -1 and N. If N is 0,
pushes 0.

### zu (Non-zero)

Syntax: `za*Value*`

Filters all non-positive values from the stack for the top *Value* values.
If *Value* is not specified, the entire stack is considered.

Bug: This should probably not filter negative values, but alas.

## Example automata

### The Game of Life

Incantation:

```
ki mi a2 a3 u ki mi8 a3 ma ya ra
```

This is the classic Game of Life (Conway's Life) automata.
