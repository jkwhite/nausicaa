- DONE operate directly on rgba channel values
- stack of 2d with each rule separate, composited in 2d from 3d
- allow a reduced color spectrum for rendering
- minimum threshold for non-invisible cells for rendering
- plot along 1d/2d/3d based on parameterized rules e.g. fractal plane
- DONE 1d rules are broken
- DONE allow update weight to vary by multisequence
- DONE asynchronous updates
- DONE json format
- DONE abort codon
- DONE randomness
- DONE border modes
- spectrum editor
